# About
These are my notes from design patterns course I took on Charles University, faculty of physics and mathematics. It's mainly just for me and I don't recommend using this text as a learning material. However, I think it might be useful as a revision material.
I have also written some code examples to each design pattern, which could also potentially be quite useful.
